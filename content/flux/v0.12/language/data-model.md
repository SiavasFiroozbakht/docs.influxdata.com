Flux employs a basic data model built from basic data types.
The data model consists of tables, records, columns and streams.

## Record
A **record** is a tuple of named values and is represented using an object type.

## Column
A **column** has a label and a data type.
The available data types for a column are:

| Data type | Description                               |
| --------- |:-----------                               |
| bool      | A boolean value, true or false.           |
| uint      | An unsigned 64-bit integer.               |
| int       | A signed 64-bit integer.                  |
| float     | An IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point number. |
| string    | A sequence of unicode characters.         |
| bytes     | A sequence of byte values.                |
| time      | A nanosecond precision instant in time.   |
| duration  | A nanosecond precision duration of time.  |

## Table
A **table** is set of records with a common set of columns and a group key.

The group key is a list of columns.
A table's group key denotes which subset of the entire dataset is assigned to the table.
All records within a table will have the same values for each column that is part of the group key.
These common values are referred to as the "group key value" and can be represented as a set of key value pairs.

A tables schema consists of its group key and its columns' labels and types.

## Stream of tables
A **stream** represents a potentially unbounded set of tables.
A stream is grouped into individual tables using their respective group keys.
Tables within a stream each have a unique group key value.

## Missing values
A record may be missing a value for a specific column.
Missing values are represented with a special `null` value.
The `null` value can be of any data type.
