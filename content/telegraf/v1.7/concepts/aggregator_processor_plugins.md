As of release 1.1.0, Telegraf has the concept of aggregator and processor plugins.

These plugins sit in-between input plugins and output plugins, aggregating and processing
metrics as they pass through Telegraf:

Both aggregators and processors analyze metrics as they pass through Telegraf.

**Processor** plugins process metrics as they pass through and immediately emit
results based on the values they process. For example, this could be printing
all metrics or adding a tag to all metrics that pass through.

**Aggregator** plugins, on the other hand, are a bit more complicated. Aggregators
are typically for emitting new _aggregate_ metrics, such as a running mean,
minimum, maximum, quantiles, or standard deviation. For this reason, all _aggregator_
plugins are configured with a `period`. The `period` is the size of the window
of metrics that each _aggregate_ represents. In other words, the emitted
_aggregate_ metric will be the aggregated value of the past `period` seconds.
Since many users will only care about their aggregates and not every single metric
gathered, there is also a `drop_original` argument, which tells Telegraf to only
emit the aggregates and not the original metrics.

**NOTE** That since aggregators only aggregate metrics within their period, that
historical data is not supported. In other words, if your metric timestamp is more
than `now() - period` in the past, it will not be aggregated. If this is a feature
that you need, please comment on this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/issues/1992)
